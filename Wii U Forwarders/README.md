# Important Note

These forwarders are powered by [Boot2vWii.](https://github.com/WiiDatabase/Boot2vWii)
Boot2vWii boots a channel installed onto your Wii Menu, so you need the ones I used for it to work. This thing you're currently reading will have a list of WADs and where/how to get them, then you can install them to your Wii Menu with [yawmME](https://wii.hacks.guide/yawmme). 

**[NOTE: I will NOT help with piracy.]**

If you get an "OS Error" upon launching the forwarder, just boot Riivolution from the [Homebrew Channel.](https://github.com/SammyGoesHowdy/SammysJunk/edit/main/Wii%20U%20Forwarders/README.md#homebrew-channel)
