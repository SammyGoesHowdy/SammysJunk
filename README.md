This repository includes WADs, Wii U Forwarders, and Homebrew created by me.

* To use anything here, you must have a modded [Wii](https://wii.hacks.guide) or [Wii U](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/)

‚ùå - If you receive a black screen, freeze after the Health & Safety screen, or "The system files are corrupted" error, go to this [page](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Wii:Banner_Unbrick) to unbrick your console. 
* Once you've unbricked your device, go to my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FeSVNNBCej), then go to #report-a-wad. and mention what WAD bricked you and what console you installed it on, using the template in the pinned messages.
