# Information

This repository includes WADs, Wii U Forwarders, and Homebrew created by Me!

To install the Wii U Forwarders here, You need to have [Aroma](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/aroma/getting-started) setup on your Wii U console.

To install the WADs & Wii Homebrew here, you need to have your [Wii](https://wii.hacks.guide/) or [vWii](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/vwii-modding) (Wii Mode on Wii U) modded. You can find a guide for this [here.](https://wii.hacks.guide/yawmme)

✅If it was installed correctly, you should see it on your Wii Menu.

❌If you see a "The System Files are corrupted." error on any WADs here... then don't worry! You have some recovery options.
